## Project 3 For The [Metis](http://www.thisismetis.com/) Data Science Program


A website that takes diagnostic information from someone experiencing chest pain and gives a makes a yes/no prediction about their heart disease status.

Predictions are made using a gaussian naieve bayes classifier from `sklearn` trained on the Cleveland, OH subset of the [UCI Heart Disease Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease). The model has been tuned to maximize recall (minimize false negatives).
